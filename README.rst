Amulog-semantics is a tool for the semantic analysis of short sentences,
especially semi-formalized sentences in network operational data such as logs and configurations.
It provides modeling, sentence embeddings, and clustering.
This library is implemented in python3, and is mainly desinged for combination with `amulog <https://github.com/cpflat/amulog>`_.
